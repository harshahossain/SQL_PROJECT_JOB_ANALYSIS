# Background

Driven by a quest to navigate the "Data Scientist" job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, while also streamlining others work to find optimal jobs, and or focus on learning key skills.

The data being worked on this project are from [Luke Barousse's YouTube Channel](https://youtu.be/7mz73uXD9DA?si=B-UoPVksz0ZJpp3K). But used for slightly differnent perspective with some much needed changes to tailor it towards Data Science Enthusiast.

### The questions I wanted to answer though these SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying Data Scientist jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are the most in demand for Data Scientists?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools Used

- **SQL:** The backbone of this analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The database management system, ideal for handing the data from the job postings.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & Github:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracing.

# The Analysis

Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of tehe data scientist job market.
Here's how every question was aproached:

### 1. Top Paying Data Scientist Jobs:

To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data scientist positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highliths are high paying opportunities in the field.
